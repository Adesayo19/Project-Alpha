<h1><strong><a name="#Lifestyle Section 1">1.Former Nailsea and Backwell rugby captain to walk 105 miles?</strong></h1>
    <p> 
        Former Nailsea and Backwell rugby player Tony Perfect is embarking on a 105-mile walk for charity.

He is set to start at Thornbury Rugby Club later, finishing on Saturday after visiting 36 rugby clubs.

Mr Perfect took on the challenge in memory of his friend Cheryl Reed, who died from cancer last year.

"I coached Cheryl and [her husband] Ian's son, Joe, and the couple were hugely supporting to our club," he said.

"She was a great supporter of [the charity] Sporting Family Change too, so I wanted to do something in her memory."

The trek, which will raise money for the charity, will finish at his old club Nailsea and Backwell RFC.

Ms Reed was a volunteer at the Bath-based organisation, which encourages people to make lifestyle changes to boost health and wellbeing.
   
Mr Perfect began training for the challenge at the start of the year.

"I decided just before Christmas we would do this...Cheryl had a great sense of fun, an amazing smile and personality. I have deep love [for her and Ian]," he said.

"I think I'm quite prepared mentally but it's the physical side of things that will be the challenge - and making sure my feet are okay."

His walk is being supported by 36 clubs, including Bristol Bears Rugby, Keynsham Rugby and Cleeve RFC.

Former Bath Rugby player Jimmy Deane, who set up the charity in 2014, will join Mr Perfect for part of the walk.

"We are really grateful [to him]. As a charity we are privileged to support children, young people and adults," he said.

"Despite our name, it's really not about being super sporty or super fit - it's about bringing people together from all walks of life, having fun and meeting new people."

        <p> 
            This year marks the 20th anniversary of H&M’s famous guest designer collaborations, an initiative that profoundly changed the landscape of modern fashion. To celebrate this special anniversary, H&M is now revisiting its most legendary and beloved collaborative collections through a special release of pre-loved items.
       
            H&M launched its first designer collection with Karl Lagerfeld, then creative director of Chanel, in 2004. The initiative revolutionised the fashion industry by making the work of the world’s greatest designers and brands accessible, expanding the profile of some of fashion’s greatest creators, and cementing the principle that great design transcends price. Each collaboration has been unique, responding to the values and principles of the guest designer.  

           <em> “Our aim was to introduce the world of fashion to consumers globally, while showcasing our connection to strong, thoughtful and original design. It connects to the fundamental ethos of H&M: that quality and creativity should be available for everyone.” </em>
       
           Now, fashion lovers have a second chance to access iconic pieces from these era-defining collaborations, through H&M’s pre-loved initiative. The items were sourced through partnerships with the online pre-loved marketplace Sellpy and global vintage retailers. Giving a second life to pre-loved garments is part of H&M’s commitment to moving towards a circular fashion economy through innovative sustainable solutions for our customers.   

           <em>“Through working with pre-loved pieces, we can bring these collections back to fashion fans giving them the chance to love these collections all over again, while introducing iconic fashion moments from H&M and the world’s top design talents to a new generation.” </em>

        <h1><strong><a name="#Lifestyle Section 3">3.Geography KS3: Life in China - Shanghai.</strong></h1>
            <p> 
                A child-led introduction to the city of Shanghai, China.

                Shanghai lies at the mouth of the Yangtze River on the coast of the East China Sea and it is one of the busiest ports in the world.
                
                Shanghai is a modern city with a sophisticated highway and metro system and an endless stream of maritime traffic navigating its way to the East China Sea.
                
                Juewen is a 10-year-old girl who represents the new generation of driven Chinese children.
                
                She has a very busy school life and then takes lots of extra classes, travelling round the city on the metro to fit in all her activities.
                
                We see her in different lessons - playing the cello, model-making (design and technology), Olympic maths, English and calligraphy.
