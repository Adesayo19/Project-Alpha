<h1><strong><a name="Laliga News">1.Robert Lewandowski scored twice in three minutes as La Liga leaders Barcelona thrashed Real Madrid in El Clasico to move six points clear of their rivals.</strong></h1>
    <p> 
        Real were looking to extend their run of unbeaten games to 43 in the league, which would have equalled the record set by Barcelona between April 2017 and May 2018.

        But their hopes of doing that were quashed by a devastating second-half display by their opponents at the Bernabeu.
        
        "It's a hard moment, a tough moment when you lose a game, [especially after] so many unbeaten," said Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti.
        
        After a goalless first half, Lewandowski broke the deadlock in the 54th minute with a clinical finish from Marc Casado's through ball.
        
        The Poland striker then stunned the hosts with a second, heading Alejandro Balde's cross into the right corner.
        
        Lewandowski had two good chances to complete a hat-trick, hitting the woodwork from the first before firing over from a good position.
        
        Spanish teenage star Lamine Yamal, 17, got Barcelona's third when he drove into the top corner from an angle, with his goal making him the youngest-ever scorer in El Clasico.
        
        Raphinha then lobbed a fourth late on for his first goal against Real Madrid.
        
        The result ensured Kylian Mbappe's first taste of the famous fixture ended in defeat with the France striker having had two goals disallowed for offside and also been denied by Inaki Pena in the Barcelona goal.

    <h1><strong><a name="#Premier League News">2.Mohamed Salah strikes late to deny Arsenal and rescue point for Liverpool.</strong></h1>
        <p> 
            The numbers speak for themselves. Mohamed Salah does not only make hay against the Premier League’s lesser lights, he routinely damages Liverpool’s rivals in the so-called Big Six. And so it was again here. Yet again.

            The first half had been a story of Bukayo Saka’s excellence for Arsenal. He scored a wonderful opener and, after Virgil van Dijk had helped Liverpool back up from the canvas, there was a first Arsenal goal for Mikel Merino. Mikel Arteta’s team looked set for a statement victory in a game that they dared not lose.
            
            Everything changed in the second half. Arsenal lost Gabriel Magalhães and Jurriën Timber to injuries, depleting their already stretched defensive reserves, and Liverpool kept on coming. They did not create much but they only needed to create something. When they did, Salah made it count for a result that further swelled the feelgood factor under Arne Slot.

            It was Darwin Núñez who played the final pass after excellent work by Trent Alexander-Arnold and there was Salah to sweep home. When the low cross reached him, the finish was not in doubt and the statistics now show that Salah has 62 combined goals and assists in 73 appearances against Arsenal, Chelsea, Tottenham and the Manchester clubs. It was his 11th league goal in 15 appearances against Arsenal.
            
            The draw was the fair result, even if Arsenal would rage at the very end when the substitute Gabriel Jesus had the ball in the net. The referee, Anthony Taylor, had long since blown his whistle, although it was not entirely clear why in the moment.
            
            Arteta had said on Tuesday that Saka, who had not played since England’s loss to Greece on 10 October, was “unlikely” to be involved but everybody knows it is never wise to read too much into his injury steers. Saka showed zero sign of any ring-rust.

            It is worth dwelling on how he manipulated the space for the breakthrough goal, how he tied Andy Robertson inside and out with a touch of mesmeric brilliance. Saka’s first one had been to bring a long Ben White ball up the channel under his influence but it was all about the second; an impish nutmeg with the outside of his left boot on Robertson as he sliced inside. It even had a bit of stun on it, which opened up the shooting opportunity. Saka banged the finish high inside Caoimhín Kelleher’s near post.

        <h1><strong><a name="#International News">3.England provisional Euro 2024 squad: Who will Gareth Southgate select?.</strong></h1>
            <p> 
                Gareth Southgate has some major injury problems, and some big decisions to make, when he names his provisional squad for the Euros on Tuesday lunchtime.

                Expect it to include more than 30 names. But the really contentious calls will come when he has to narrow the training squad down to a final 26 for the tournament, in less than three weeks' time.
                
                The highest profile call may well be the inclusion, or absence, of Marcus Rashford.
                
                He has 60 caps and has been integral to Southgate's England since the 2018 World Cup in Russia, but many pundits feel his form for Manchester United this season doesn't warrant a place in the Euros squad - especially seeing as he is doing battle in one of the most competitive positions in the England side.
            
                Eight goals and five assists in all competitions is the lowest goal-involvement tally of all those players he is competing with, though we know the England manager is hugely influenced by a players' international experience, and the job they have done for England in the past - which is where Rashford scores highly.
        
                It may well be that Southgate includes the winger in his training squad, but kicks the can down the road a bit, in terms of the ultimate Rashford decision. 11pm on June 7 is the deadline for all teams to submit their final tournament squads to UEFA. The England boss may want to use the two final warm-up games against Bosnia and Iceland to test a few players, and give game-time to those with injury concerns, before making his ultimate choice.

                Rashford himself has missed some action in the last month with bruised ribs and a bruised heel. He hasn't played more than 15 minutes of international football in any single game since last November.

            <h1><strong><a name="#Transfer News">3.Free-agent Balotelli nears Genoa switch - medical set for Monday!.</strong></h1>
                <p> 
                    Mario Balotelli is close to a return to Serie A with a move to Genoa, according to Sky in Italy.

                    The former Manchester City striker is a free agent after leaving Turkish side Adana Demirspor in June.
                    
                    A deal to take Balotelli to Genoa has nearly been finalised and the player is expected to undergo a medical on Monday.
                
                    <h1>Carragher: Trent sounds like he's going to Real</h1>
Jamie Carragher says Trent Alexander-Arnold's looks though as he is considering joining Real Madrid.
Alexander-Arnold, whose contract at Anfield expires at the end of the season, said in a recent interview with Sky Sports' Harriet Prior that he would like to become the first right-back to win the coveted Balon d'Or award for best player in the world.

"My first thought when I saw that is you're not going to win the Balon d'Or as a right-back for Liverpool," Carragher said after Liverpool's 2-2 draw against Arsenal.

"Balon d'Or winners normally play for Real Madrid or Barcelona. That's where the best players in the world go.

                <h1><strong><a name="#Transfer Rumors">4.David de Gea started for Spain despite allegations over his private life.</strong></h1>
                    <p> 
                        David de Gea started for Spain in their opening Euro 2016 match, a 1-0 win against Czech Republic at the Stadium Municipal in Toulouse.

                        There had been speculation the Manchester United goalkeeper could be dropped after being forced to deny allegations about his private life. 
                        
                        De Gea has since quashed the rumours and branded the allegations as "lies", insisting he was focused solely on helping Spain win a third consecutive European Championship. 
                        
                        He was given the nod ahead of Porto goalkeeper Iker Casillas by manager Vicente del Bosque and thus made his first appearance at a major international tournament.
                        Spain began their Group D campaign with a 1-0 victory against the Czechs, ahead of clashes against Turkey and Croatia.
