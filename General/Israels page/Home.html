<h1><strong><a name="War News">1.Iran’s supreme leader signals measured response to Israel’s attack</strong></h1>
<p> 
    Ayatollah Ali Khamenei tries to balance domestic expectations with risk of escalating regional conflict


	Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has signalled a measured response to Israel’s attack on the Islamic republic rather than an immediate reprisal as Tehran tries to balance domestic expectations with the risk of escalating regional conflict.

Speaking a day after Israel launched three waves of strikes on Iran, Khamenei made a public speech, warning against complacency and suggesting the response would be measured.

“The viciousness of the Zionist regime should neither be overestimated nor underestimated,” Khamenei said, while adding that Israel’s “strategic miscalculations” should be countered.

Khamenei, the republic’s ultimate decision maker, refrained from issuing any direct threats of retaliation, instead saying that senior Iranian officials would determine how Tehran responded. “The manner of making the Zionist regime understand the power and resolve of the Iranian nation is up to our officials, who will take whatever action best serves this country,” he said.

Khamenei’s comments come amid concerns that the conflict between Israel, Iran and Iranian-backed militants is pushing the Middle East towards a full-blown war. They suggest the regime is keen to reassure Iranians that Israel’s strikes have not caused the level of damage initially feared.

In the early hours of Saturday, Israeli warplanes struck multiple military targets across three provinces in Iran, including Tehran. Israeli jets did not enter Iranian airspace, instead launching the missiles from Iraq, Iran said. The Israeli military said it targeted missile manufacturing plants and air defences, in retaliation for the ballistic missile barrage Iran fired at Israel three weeks ago.

The Israeli strikes killed four soldiers.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday that Israel’s air force had “attacked throughout Iran” and “severely damaged Iran’s defence capability and its ability to produce missiles”.

“The attack was precise and powerful and achieved its goals. This regime must understand a simple principle — whoever hurts us, we hurt him,” Netanyahu said at a ceremony to mark the Israelis killed since Hamas launched its October 7 attack that triggered the war. “This is the principle that has guided us until today and it is the principle that will motivate us later on.”

Iran’s initial reaction was to play down the impact of the strikes. On Saturday, the General Staff of the Armed Forces said the republic “reserved its legal and legitimate right to respond at an appropriate time”.

In a statement, it said Iran’s emphasis was on supporting a ceasefire in Gaza and Lebanon where Israeli forces are fighting Hamas and Hizbollah respectively; the militant groups are backed by the republic. 

Israel’s strikes were in retaliation for an Iranian attack on October 1, when the republic fired 180 ballistic missiles at Israel. That was in response to Israel’s assassination of Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hizbollah, the Lebanese movement that is Iran’s most important proxy.

But the foes appeared to want to avoid an all-out war.

Israel’s government has remained largely silent about the attack on Iran, after Netanyahu banned his ministers from granting interviews on Saturday. Instead, the Israeli military was left to describe in vague terms the “precise strikes” on missile production sites and air defences and issue warnings of future attacks if Tehran retaliated.

The US had pressed Israel to avoid striking Iran’s nuclear sites or oil facilities as Netanyahu’s government prepared its response to the Iranian ballistic missile attack three weeks ago.  

After Israel declared the assault over, the Biden administration said Israel’s response should mark the end of the latest cycle of attacks between the foes. The US has conveyed this message directly and indirectly to Tehran, the official said.

If Iran responds, Washington will defend and support Israel and “there will be consequences”, the official added.

On Saturday, in telephone conversations with his Egyptian and Qatari counterparts, foreign minister Abbas Araghchi said that “Iran will not hesitate to respond decisively and proportionately to any violation of its territorial integrity”, but added that any response would come at “an appropriate time”.

Iran’s armed forces claimed in the statement that a “significant” number of Israeli missiles were intercepted, while those that did reach their targets caused only “limited damage” to radar systems, some of which have already been repaired.

<h1><strong><a name="Sports News">2.Robert Lewandowski scored twice in three minutes as La Liga leaders Barcelona thrashed Real Madrid in El Clasico to move six points clear of their rivals.</strong></h1>
    <p> 
        Real were looking to extend their run of unbeaten games to 43 in the league, which would have equalled the record set by Barcelona between April 2017 and May 2018.

        But their hopes of doing that were quashed by a devastating second-half display by their opponents at the Bernabeu.
        
        "It's a hard moment, a tough moment when you lose a game, [especially after] so many unbeaten," said Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti.
        
        After a goalless first half, Lewandowski broke the deadlock in the 54th minute with a clinical finish from Marc Casado's through ball.
        
        The Poland striker then stunned the hosts with a second, heading Alejandro Balde's cross into the right corner.
        
        Lewandowski had two good chances to complete a hat-trick, hitting the woodwork from the first before firing over from a good position.
        
        Spanish teenage star Lamine Yamal, 17, got Barcelona's third when he drove into the top corner from an angle, with his goal making him the youngest-ever scorer in El Clasico.
        
        Raphinha then lobbed a fourth late on for his first goal against Real Madrid.
        
        The result ensured Kylian Mbappe's first taste of the famous fixture ended in defeat with the France striker having had two goals disallowed for offside and also been denied by Inaki Pena in the Barcelona goal.

    Voters, reporters and the candidates alike are being inundated with polling data in the lead up to election day. And that's true again today.

    In recent polling data released from the BBC's US partner CBS News, it shows that nationally Harris leads Trump by one percentage point - 50% to 49%.
    
    In the battleground states, the opponents are tied with 50% support each.
    
    But there's a bigger gender gap between the candidates, the CBS News polling data found.
    
    Women support Harris, 55% to Trump's 43%, while men support Trump 54% to Harris's 45%.
    
    The Harris-Walz campaign has released their schedule for the coming days, and it's going to be a busy one across all seven swing states.

    Harris will be in the Philadelphia area todaywhile her running mate Tim Walz spends time in Nevada
    On MondayHarris will head to Michigan with Walz and the vice-presidential contender will also make a stop in Wisconsin
    Harris will then speak in front of an estimated 20,000 people in Washington DC on Tuesday while Walz heads to Georgia
    By mid-week,Harris is expected to make campaign stops in North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin - Walz will also make his way to North Carolina
    By Thursday,the ticket will split up and Harris will make a handful of west-coast stops in Nevada and Arizona. Her running mate will be on the other side of the country, with stops in Michigan and Pennsylvania

    "You're experiencing the strength and ferocity of Mother Nature and know it's heading towards people."

    Reconnaissance missions like this are just one way that scientists and forecasters try to shed light on these monstrous storms, as they grow in size and move ever closer to causing destruction. 
    
    So let us take you on a similar journey - all the way from where a hurricane is born to where it dies.
    
    We start thousands of miles away from the Americas - over the African continent.

    Once peak sustained wind speeds hit 74mph (119km/h), the tropical storm is officially a hurricane. Above 111mph (178km/h), it becomes a major hurricane. 

Skirting the coast of South America, most Atlantic hurricanes pass across the Caribbean before approaching the US, Mexico and Central America.
