<h1><strong><a name="#Kamila Speech News">1.Would Harris's price gouging plan really help US consumers?</strong></h1>
    <p> 
        When Kamala Harris was asked on Wednesday what she would do to help an undecided voter worried about the price of groceries, she said she would introduce a national ban on price gouging.

        Her plan, she told an audience in Pennsylvania, would “stop companies taking advantage of the desperation and need of the American consumer and jacking up prices without any consequences”.
        
        The proposed ban - one of her key economic policies - would apply during "times of crisis", external.
        
        But would it really bring down prices for consumers? And could it even prove potentially counterproductive?
        
        The backdrop of rising prices
        Rising prices have been a key concern for Americans in recent years and polls suggest , externala majority of Americans feel worse off than they did four years ago.
        
        In April 2024, the share of Americans naming the high cost of living, external as the most important financial problem facing their family reached 41%, the highest since 2005.
        
        Overall inflation peaked, external at 9.1% in the year to June 2022, rates not seen in four decades.
        
        And food inflation peaked even higher, reaching 11.4% in the year to August 2022.
        
        Both are now back below 3%, though average US food prices are still around 27% higher than at the end of 2019.
        
        Inflation has been a global problem, but some economists argue, external that the economic stimulus policies of the Biden-Harris administration contributed to this spike in US prices, making inflation an issue on which she is keen to reassure voters.
        
        There have also been claims that some corporate retailers took the coronavirus pandemic in 2020 - when supply chains were disrupted and people's lives and shopping habits severely impacted by lockdowns - as an opportunity to increase their prices and profit margins.
        
        This phenomenon has been dubbed by some as “greedflation” and forms the economic justification for Harris’s price gouging ban.
        
        Donald Trump has compared her plan to “communist price control, external” and “like something straight out of Venezuela or the Soviet Union.”

    <h1><strong><a name="#Trump Speech News">2.Investigating Trump campaign’s biggest illegal voter claim</strong></h1>
        <p> 
            The message was addressed to “REAL AMERICAN PATRIOTS” to ensure a victory “TOO BIG TO RIG!”

            Sent out to a mailing list by the Republican National Committee co-chair Lara Trump, it combined two of the biggest themes of Donald Trump’s campaign: immigration and alleged election fraud.
            
            “Experts are saying that as many as 2.7 million illegals could vote in November,” read the email from Ms Trump - the former president’s daughter-in-law.
            
            But the number cited is derived from a decade-old survey that has been heavily disputed.
            
            And while there is some clear evidence that some immigrants are registered to vote, it’s equally clear that the 2.7 million figure is a major exaggeration.
            
            <em>The origin story</em>
            The roots of the statistic are found in an article, “Do non-citizens vote in U.S. elections?”, external, published in the journal Electoral Studies in 2014.
            
            Written by three academics led by Jesse Richman, an associate professor at Old Dominion University in Virginia, the paper says the "number of non-citizen voters… could range from just over 38,000 at the very minimum to nearly 2.8 million at the maximum”.
            
            <em>Election polls - is Harris or Trump ahead?</em>
            
            Mr Richman and his colleagues did not comb through voter rolls or personally survey immigrants to come to that conclusion, but instead relied on a data set from a long-running Harvard-backed survey called the Cooperative Election Study, external (CES).
            
            The CES is conducted every year, and Mr Richman examined a number of respondents who self-identified as non-citizens and indicated that they had voted in the 2008 and 2010 elections.
            
            But the people behind CES have repeatedly rejected the conclusions of Mr Richman's paper, which attracted controversy and attention before and after the 2016 presidential election.
            
            Brian Schaffner, a Tufts University professor who is one of the CES co-principal investigators, told the BBC that it’s not possible to draw statistical conclusions from a relatively small number of survey participants.
            
            The CES is intended to be a survey of legal voters, and few respondents say they are non-citizens. For example, in 2008, 339 out of the nearly 34,000 survey participants said they were not US citizens. The proportion was similar in 2010.
            
            That does not constitute a representative sample of the population, Schaffner said, and it's a commonly known issue in large surveys - a small proportion of people click wrong or untrue answers.
            
            <em>The 1% claim</em>
            In recent years, the CES has included more detailed questions about citizenship and registration with the aim of increasing accuracy.
            
            Mr Richman, the author of the Electoral Studies article, drew on that more recent CES data to conclude in 2023 that 1% of non-citizens were registered to vote. That would be approximately 117,000 people based on official estimates of how many undocumented immigrants are in the US.
            
            In an interview with the BBC, he said he stood by his findings - but noted that a substantial uncertainty about non-citizen voting registration and voting remained.
            
            "Predictably, according to what tends to happen in American politics, each side focuses on the edge of that uncertainty that is most convenient," Mr Richman said.
            
            "Democrats would like there to be absolutely none. Republicans would like it to be a monster that is about to eat democracy. Both of those interpretations are not likely."
            
            But Mr Schaffner, the CES official, is equally adamant about his argument, that the study he administers is simply not suitable for extrapolation to the population at large to create an estimate of non-citizen voting.

        <h1><strong><a name="#British Political News">3.Labour suspends MP after CCTV appears to show him punching man.</strong></h1>
            <p> 
                Labour MP Mike Amesbury has been suspended from the party and has had the whip withdrawn, after CCTV footage emerged appearing to show him punching a man to the ground.

                In footage obtained by the Daily Mail,, external the Runcorn and Helsby MP is apparently seen continuing to hit the man as he lies in the street.
                
                Cheshire Police said a 55-year-old man has been voluntarily interviewed under caution in relation to the incident and has since been released pending further enquiries.
                
                Amesbury has been contacted for comment.
                
                It comes after a different video, posted on X, purported to show Amesbury shouting and swearing at the man lying in the street in Frodsham, Cheshire.
                
                A Labour party spokesman said: “Mike Amesbury MP has been assisting Cheshire Police with their inquiries following an incident on Friday night.
                
                "As these inquiries are now ongoing, the Labour Party has administratively suspended Mr Amesbury’s membership of the Labour Party pending an investigation.”
                
                He has also lost the Labour whip in the House of Commons.
                
                It is not clear what happened in the build-up to the moments caught on film.
                
                In the initial clip, Amesbury can be heard shouting: "You won't threaten the MP ever again, will you?"
                
                In a statement issued before the Daily Mail footage emerged, Cheshire Police said: “At 02:48 BST on Saturday 26 October police were called to reports of an assault in Frodsham.
                
                “A caller reported he had been assaulted by a man in Main Street. Enquiries are ongoing.”
                
                Posting on his own Facebook page on Saturday, the 55-year-old backbencher said: "Last night I was involved in an incident that took place after I felt threatened following an evening out with friends.
                
                "This morning I contacted Cheshire Police myself to report what happened.
                
                "I will not be making any further public comment but will of course cooperate with any inquiries if required by Cheshire Police."

                <h1><strong><a name="#War News">4.Iran leader says Israeli attack should not be 'exaggerated or downplayed'.</strong></h1>
                    <p> 
                        Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei has given a measured response to Israeli strikes on the country, saying the attack should not be "exaggerated or downplayed" while refraining from pledging immediate retaliation.

President Masoud Pezeshkian said Iran would "give an appropriate response" to the attack, which killed at least four soldiers, adding that Tehran did not seek war.

Israel said it targeted military sites in several regions of Iran on Saturday in retaliation for Iranian attacks, including a barrage of almost 200 ballistic missiles fired towards Israel on 1 October.

On Sunday Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel had crippled Iranian air defence and missile production systems. He said the strikes had "severely damaged Iran’s defence capability and its ability to produce missiles".

"The attack was precise and powerful and achieved its goals," Netanyahu said at a ceremony commemorating the victims of last year's 7 October attacks.

"This regime must understand a simple principle: whoever hurts us, we hurt him."

Official Iranian sources have publicly played down the impact of the attack, saying most missiles were intercepted and those that weren't caused only limited damage to air defence systems.

In his first public comments since the attack, Khamenei said: "It is up to the authorities to determine how to convey the power and will of the Iranian people to the Israeli regime and to take actions that serve the interests of this nation and country."

President Pezeshkian largely echoed the supreme leader's language, telling a cabinet meeting: "We do not seek war, but we will defend the rights of our nation and country."

The Israeli strikes were more limited than some observers had been expecting. The US had publicly pressured Israel not to hit oil and nuclear facilities, advice seemingly heeded by Tel Aviv.

The Iranian foreign minister said on Sunday that Iran had "received indications" about an impending attack hours before it took place.

"We had received indications since the evening about the possibility of an attack that night," Abbas Araghchi told reporters, without going into more detail.

Western countries have urged Iran in turn not to respond in order to break the cycle of escalation between both Middle Eastern countries, which they fear could lead to all-out regional war.

Iranian media has carried footage of daily life continuing as normal and framing the "limited" damage as a victory, a choice analysts said was intended to reassure Iranians.

                    <h1><strong><a name="#US Political News">5.What are Harris and Trump's policies?.</strong></h1>
                        <p> 
                            American voters will face a clear choice for president on election day, between Democratic Vice-President Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump.

                            Here's a look at what they stand for and how their policies compare on different issues.
                            
                            Inflation
Harris has said her day-one priority would be trying to reduce food and housing costs for working families.

She promises to ban price-gouging on groceries, help first-time home buyers and provide incentives to increase housing supply.

Inflation soared under the Biden presidency, as it did in many western countries, partly due to post-Covid supply issues and the Ukraine war. It has fallen since.

Trump has promised to “end inflation and make America affordable again” and when asked he says more drilling for oil will lower energy costs.

He has promised to deliver lower interest rates, something the president does not control, and he says deporting undocumented immigrants will ease pressure on housing. Economists warn that his vow to impose higher tax on imports could push up prices.
                        
Taxes
Harris wants to raise taxes on big businesses and Americans making $400,000 (£305,000) a year.

But she has also unveiled a number of measures that would ease the tax burden on families, including an expansion of child tax credits.

She has broken with Biden over capital gains tax, supporting a more moderate rise from 23.6% to 28% compared with his 44.6%.

Trump proposes a number of tax cuts worth trillions, including an extension of his 2017 cuts which mostly helped the wealthy.

He says he will pay for them through higher growth and tariffs on imports. Analysts say both tax plans will add to the ballooning deficit, but Trump’s by more.
