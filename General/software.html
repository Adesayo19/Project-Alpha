<h1><em>Mayor and 15 others killed in Israeli strike on Lebanon council meeting</h1></em>
<p>
    The UN’s special coordinator for Lebanon has criticised Israel after air strikes on municipal buildings in the southern city of Nabatieh killed the mayor and 15 other people.

Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert called the killing of mayor Ahmad Kahil <strong>“alarming”</strong> and said any violations of international humanitarian law were <strong>“completely unacceptable”</strong>.

At least five of those killed in Wednesday's strike were municipal staff co-ordinating aid for civilians remaining in the area, Nabatiyeh Governor Howaida Turk told the BBC.

Lebanon’s caretaker prime minister, Najib Mikati condemned the attack, saying it had <strong>"intentionally"</strong> targeted a council meeting.

The attack was the most significant against a Lebanese state building since the latest escalation in fighting, which began about two weeks ago, and has raised concerns about the safety of the country’s state infrastructure.

A spokesman for the Israeli military said its forces had launched raids targeting dozens of Hezbollah targets in the area and destroyed a tunnel used by the Iran-backed group.

<strong>"We know that Hezbollah many times takes advantage of civilian facilities,"</strong> Israel's UN ambassador Danny Danon said at a meeting of the UN in New York City on Wednesday.

Turk, the governor, said that while the majority of Nabatieh residents had already left the area following heavy Israeli air strikes, the mayor and other municipal employees had stayed behind to help those who remained.

<strong>“This is just like strikes all over Lebanon,”</strong> she said.

<strong>“They [Israel] have hit civilians, Red Cross, civil defence. Now they have targeted a government building. It is unacceptable. It is a massacre.”</strong>

Previous strikes on Nabatieh over the past few days have destroyed historic buildings, including an Ottoman-era market dating to 1910.</p>

<h1><em>Arsenal's Front Three Trio Injury Crisis</em></h1>
<p>
    Kai Havertz, Gabriel Martinelli, Bukayo Saka. Arsenal's three goalscorers in the comeback win over Southampton. Arsenal's three players to suffer injury scares during the international break.
    Havertz pulled out of the Germany squad due to knee issues, Saka limped away from England's loss to Greece with a hamstring problem and Martinelli missed Brazil's final game with a calf injury.
    With captain Martin Odegaard already confirmed to be out until November at the very least, it is not an ideal situation for the Gunners - especially given how impressive Arsenal's front three have been.
    All three can safely say they are in good form, so much so that with Leandro Trossard needed to cover Odegaard's midfield role, and Gabriel Jesus and Raheem Sterling limited to back-up options (although both started against Southampton), their first-choice status seems pretty safe for now.
    And with a tricky run of fixtures on the horizon, starting with Saturday's trip to Bournemouth live on Sky Sports, Mikel Arteta will need that front three fit and firing.
    Saka has been scintillating, especially from a creativity point of view. Seven assists in his opening seven games puts him in esteemed company for top-flight assist-makers at this stage of the season.

<h1><em>Israeli strike 'kills 15 including children' at Gaza school</em></h1>
<p>
    Fifteen people have been killed, including at least five children, by an Israeli strike on a school-turned-shelter in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.
The Abu Hussein school, in Jabalia, northern Gaza, was sheltering displaced people, Gaza health ministry official Medhat Abbas told Reuters.
Dozens were injured in the strike, he said, adding:<strong>"There is no water to extinguish the fire. There is nothing."</strong>
The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) said the attack targeted dozens of Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants who had gathered at the site.
Fares Abu Hamza, head of the ministry's emergency unit in northern Gaza, said the nearby Kamal Adwan Hospital was struggling to treat the casualties.
<strong>"Many women and children are in critical condition,"</strong> he added.
Footage showed emergency workers rushing the wounded out of the compound amid debris and crowds of people, according to AP.
It comes as earlier this week, Israeli forces struck at another school in Nuseirat, central Gaza, killing 23 people.
In northern Gaza, Israel has been waging a major air and ground operation for more than a week.
After the most recent attack, Israel provided a list of names it claimed were militants present when the strike was called in.
Israel has killed over 42,000 Palestinians since Hamas-led militants stormed into the south of the country on 7 October, killing around <strong>1,200</strong> people and abducting <strong>others</strong>.
The figure, which comes from the enclave's health ministry, does not differentiate between civilians and combatants but says women and children make up more than half the dead.

<h1>CLIMATE NEWS</h1>
<h1><em>Will there be more Atlantic hurricanes in 2024? Why Milton may not be the last</em></h1>
<p>
    After a slow start, there have now been 13 named Atlantic storms this season. With more than six weeks to go, there's still time for more hurricanes to form.
    Back in May, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) warned that this year's season - running from 1 June to 30 November - had an <strong>85%</strong> of being more active than usual.
    An average year will see a total of 14 named storms, of which seven will be regular hurricanes and three will be major ones.
    Latest - Biden tells Trump <strong>'get a life'</strong> and help storm victims - as number killed rises
    After a slow start - the slowest in 10 years - things have picked up recently. Of the 13 named storms, nine became hurricanes, with four reaching major hurricane status (rated Category 3 and above on the Saffir-Simpson scale).
    Two have reached Category 5, the highest possible; Beryl - the most powerful storm to ever make landfall so early in the season, which formed at the end of June - and Milton, which hit Florida this week.
    August was unusually quiet, likely due to thunderstorm activity over Africa being further north than usual, but things picked up through September and early October.
    We are past the peak of the season but there are more than six weeks left - so there is still time for more hurricanes to form.

<h1><strong>Paul Pogba exclusive interview: Midfielder considered retirement but now eyeing France recall after seeing ban reduced</strong></h1>
<h1><em>In a UK TV exclusive interview with Sky Sports News, Paul Pogba talks about his football ban, his previous thoughts of retirement and his future plans, as he closes in on a return to the game with Juventus in March 2025</em></h1>
<p>
Paul Pogba considered retiring from football after being handed a four-year ban from the game but he has now set his sights on a return to the France national team after seeing his punishment reduced to 18 months.
The 31-year-old tested positive for dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) - a compound that promoted the production of hormones in the body, including testosterone - but is free to start playing for Juventus from March next year following a successful appeal at the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS).
Ahead of his return to the professional game after the punishment was reduced, Pogba sat down for an exclusive interview with Sky Sports News' Chief Reporter <strong>Kaveh Solhekol</strong> to talk about the moment he found out about the ban, his journey throughout that time, and his plans for the future ahead of his return to the pitch...
Pogba stated <strong>"For sure that means I take responsibility that I took the supplement and I did not triple check, even though it came from a professional doctor. If I have to be punished, I am fine with it, but it should never be four years. I will accept 12 months."</strong>
