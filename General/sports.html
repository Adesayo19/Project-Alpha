             <h2>Amusement</h2><br />
             New Jersey was once home to some of the most beloved amusement parks that defined countless summers,<br />
              only to now exist in memory. One of the most iconic was Palisades Amusement Park, perched above the Hudson River.<br />
             It wasn’t just a park; it was a cultural touchstone. From its breathtaking view of Manhattan<br />
             to the epic roller coasters and thrilling Cyclone ride, Palisades was the place for family outings.<br />
             Lake Hopatcong’s Bertrand Island Amusement Park was another classic, blending the feel<br />
             of a lakeside retreat with amusement park thrills. Its wooden roller coaster and beachfront rides attracted families<br />
             from all over. Opening in the 1920s and closing in the early ’80s, it had a kind of small-town charm that’s rare today.</h3><br />

             <h2>Geographical News</h2><br />
             <h3>Researchers have discovered inorganic nanostructures surrounding deep-ocean hydrothermal vents that are strikingly similar<br />
                to molecules that make life as we know it possible. These nanostructures are self-organized<br />
                and act as selective ion channels, which create energy that can be harnessed in the form of electricity.<br />
                 The findings impact not only our understanding of how life began, but can also be applied to industrial blue-energy harvesting.<br />
                 Led by geology postdoctoral researcher Jingchuan Wang, the team used innovative seismic imaging techniques to peer deep<br />
                into Earth's mantle, the layer between our planet's crust and core. They found an unusually thick area in the mantle transition zone,<br />
                 a region located between about 410 and 660 kilometers below the Earth's surface. The zone separates the upper and lower mantles, expanding or contracting based on temperature.<br />
                The team believes that the newly discovered seafloor may also explain the anomalous structure of<br />
                the Pacific Large Low Shear Velocity Province (LLSVP) -- a massive region in Earth's lower mantle -- as the LLSVP appears to be split by the slab.</h3><br />

             <h3>Ten times as many migrants died in New Mexico near the US-Mexico border in each of the last two years compared with just five years ago.<br />
             During the first eight months of 2024, the bodies of 108 presumed migrants, mostly from Mexico and Central America, were found near the border in New Mexico,<br />
              according to the most recent data. Many of the bodies were discovered less than 10 miles (16km) from El Paso.<br />
             In 2023, the remains of 113 presumed migrants were found near the state’s border with Mexico. In 2020, nine bodies of were found. In 2019, there were 10.<br />
            It is not clear exactly why so many more people are succumbing in that area, but many experts say smugglers are treating migrants<br />
             more harshly and bringing them on paths that could be more dangerous in extreme summer temperatures.</h3><br />
