I am not a cheater – Paul Pogba targets France return after reduced doping ban
Paul Pogba has insisted he is not a cheater after his doping ban was reduced earlier this month and targeted a return to the French national team when his suspension expires in March.

Former Manchester United midfielder Pogba was banned for four years in March after being provisially suspended since September last year after he tested positive for dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA).

After a lengthy appeal process, the 31-year-old had his ban reduced to 18 months by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) on October 4 and he can resume his career in March.
The CAS judgment found Pogba’s ingestion of the banned substance “was not intentional” and was the result of erroneously taking a supplement prescribed to him by a medical doctor in Florida.

In an interview with Sky Sports News, the 2018 World Cup winner reiterated he has always been a clean athlete.

Pogba said: “I mean when you see me, you know me and people know me so even when all the thing happened, they were like ‘no, for sure we know Paul, he would never take that. If he did, he didn’t know or it wasn’t on purpose’. And this is totally the truth.

“I am an honest person and I would say it. At the end, I would say it ‘yes I did because I felt like I need it’ and that’s not the case. This is not me. I am not a cheater.

“I am someone who loves my sport, I love the game and I would never ever. I don’t like to cheat. I like to win fairly and people know that. You see it. You see me, I am someone who is a bad loser, but I am not a cheater. That’s for sure.”

While Pogba is still contracted to Juventus until 2026, the 91-capped France international was coy about his club future and fielded various questions about where his next destination could be.

A mutual termination of his contract with the Serie A club could occur, but if not Pogba can return to Juve training in January and has a big goal of resuming his international career.

Asked about returning for France, Pogba insisted: “That is what I hope. Of course it is in my mind for sure, but I have to be ready for that. There are players there that deserve to play and deserve to be national team.

“I have to win my place also in the national team again. Of course I am ready to fight.”

Arsenal's front three of Kai Havertz, Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli are all in top form - but how fit are the trio?
Arsenal forward trio Bukayo Saka, Kai Havertz and Gabriel Martinelli are all in top form, but all picked up injury issues during the international break - so are they fit?; watch Bournemouth vs Arsenal live on Sky Sports this Saturday from 5pm; kick-off 5.30pm
Kai Havertz, Gabriel Martinelli, Bukayo Saka. Arsenal's three goalscorers in the comeback win over Southampton. Arsenal's three players to suffer injury scares during the international break.

Havertz pulled out of the Germany squad due to knee issues, Saka limped away from England's loss to Greece with a hamstring problem and Martinelli missed Brazil's final game with a calf injury.

With captain Martin Odegaard already confirmed to be out until November at the very least, it is not an ideal situation for the Gunners - especially given how impressive Arsenal's front three have been.

l three can safely say they are in good form, so much so that with Leandro Trossard needed to cover Odegaard's midfield role, and Gabriel Jesus and Raheem Sterling limited to back-up options (although both started against Southampton), their first-choice status seems pretty safe for now.

Arsenal's forward line injury scares
October 6: Kai Havertz pulls out of the Germany squad with knee problems, just 24 hours after playing in the 3-1 win over Southampton.
October 10: Bukayo Saka limps out of England's loss to Greece with a hamstring issue. Lee Carsley said Saka was close to playing against Finland but was sent back to Arsenal as a precaution.
October 14: Gabriel Martinelli undergoes a MRI scan after complaining about his right calf. He is not risked in Brazil's win over Peru the following day.
And with a tricky run of fixtures on the horizon, starting with Saturday's trip to Bournemouth live on Sky Sports, Mikel Arteta will need that front three fit and firing…

    One Direction star Liam Payne dies after balcony fall 3 hours ago.
    Liam Payne, the former One Direction star, has died aged 31 in Argentina after falling from the third floor of a hotel in Buenos Aires, police say.

    In a statement, police said they discovered Payne's body after an emergency crew responded to an call in the upscale neighbourhood of Palermo on Wednesday.
    
    Payne had risen to global fame as part of the much-loved boyband created on the X Factor TV show in 2010, along with Harry Styles, Louis Tomlinson, Niall Horan and Zayn Malik.
    
    Earlier this month, Payne had attended the Argentina concert of his former One Direction bandmate Niall Horan.
    
    According to police in Buenos Aires, officers at the scene were initially responding to reports "of an aggressive man who may have been under the effects of drugs and alcohol".

    When they arrived at the hotel, officials were told a loud sound had been heard in an interior courtyard. Soon after, they discovered the body there. A police investigation has been launched.
    
    Emergency medical services director Alberto Crescenti told local media that Payne had suffered "serious injuries" and that an autopsy will be carried out.
    
    Mr Crescenti declined to answer questions about the circumstances of Payne's fall from the balcony.
    
    The star's body has been transferred to a morgue in the city.
    
    Payne posted on Snapchat just hours before the incident, saying: "It's a lovely day here in Argentina" but the video was from earlier in the week where he had spent time with his girlfriend Kate Cassidy.    

    Teenage guns for hire: Swedish gangs targeting Israeli interests
    The 13-year-old boy should have been in school last Thursday, instead of sitting in a police station in central Gothenburg. But police say he fired shots outside the offices of Israeli tech firm Elbit Systems.

“He was basically caught in the act,” said police spokesman August Brandt, who said the shots were being investigated as an “attempted murder and weapons offence”.

Kalleback on the outskirts of Gothenburg is a fairly sleepy residential neighbourhood with upmarket developments, a supermarket and a few offices.

Nobody was hurt and little more is known about why a child might have opened fire on an otherwise quiet Thursday morning, outside an Israeli company that sells defence and homeland security solutions.

But this was no isolated incident. In fact there have been several this year.
Earlier this month, Israel’s embassies were targeted both in Sweden and neighbouring Denmark.

First there was a shooting outside the Israeli embassy in Stockholm, then two Swedish teenagers aged 16 and 19 were arrested in Copenhagen after hand grenades were detonated near the embassy there.

Nobody was hurt, but Sweden's security service Sapo said immediately that Iran may have had a hand in both. Sapo head of operations Fredrik Hallstrom said Tehran’s involvement was an “objective hypothesis”.
Months ago Sapo accused Iran of recruiting Swedish gang members to carry out attacks on Israeli or Jewish interests.

Iran’s foreign ministry condemned the allegations as “unfounded and biased” and based on what it labelled misinformation emanating from Israel.

Many of the suspects have been teenagers, and some as young as 13 and 14.

“To understand why we see young Swedish teenagers attacking Israeli companies and embassies we need to first acknowledge that we have had an ongoing gang conflict here in Sweden for a long time,” says Diamant Salihu, an investigative crime journalist with Swedish public service television SVT.

One of Sweden’s most violent criminal gangs, known as Foxtrot, has brought a wave of violence to the streets of Sweden, often involving teenagers tasked with criminal errands ranging from shooting at the door of a rival, to detonating explosives to contract killings.

That spiralled in 2023 when Foxtrot gang leader Rawa Majid entered into a deadly feud with Ismail Abdo, a former friend who had become leader of a rival gang known as Rumba.

Nepal's inventive use for waste placentas.
The burning of medical waste poses a serious health and environmental danger. Hospitals in Nepal have started turning this hazardous waste into cooking gas.

Hospital staff close to the incinerator complained of persistent coughs, breathing difficulties, headaches, sore eyes and rashes. The black, noxious smoke that poured out of its chimney wafted in through the windows of Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital (TUTH) in Nepal's capital Kathmandu. Staff reluctantly closed them to protect their vulnerable patients: children and babies in paediatric and neonatal intensive care, and adults with respiratory illnesses.

"Keeping the windows shut caused the rooms to overheat and added to the discomfort," recalls Deepak Mahara, former TUTH executive director who has now retired. "When the incinerator was operational, smoke frequently drifted into these sensitive areas, causing significant distress. The foul smell made the work environment uncomfortable."

Despite this, no one realised their symptoms were connected to the incinerator's emissions until 2014, when a local non-profit, the Health Environment and Climate Action Foundation (HECAF360), approached hospital managers to suggest replacing the offensive furnace with an underground biodigester. Staff not only faced long-term health conditions if they continued to be exposed to the poisoned air, but the hospital was also causing broader public health and environmental dangers, HECAF360 warned. Low-quality incineration of health care waste releases dioxins and furans into the atmosphere – chemicals both classified as human carcinogens. While medical waste that is dumped outside of hospital grounds poses risks to anyone who may come into contact with it, such as waste pickers on dump sites.

"We were unaware of the negative impact of the mismanagement of healthcare waste," says Mahara. Realising the issue was serious, he agreed to take action. "It needed to be addressed immediately to comply with hospital's mission to 'do no harm'," he says.

The situation at TUTH is common. Hospitals worldwide use incinerators to eradicate rubbish. It is the method most commonly used in developing countries to dispose of infectious waste, according to a UN Human Rights Council report. The report highlights that if medical facilities have small-scale incinerators, or manage them incorrectly, this can lead to dioxins emissions that are 40,000 times higher than emission limits set forth in the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants.

In Nepal, hospitals and healthcare centres generate between 1 and 1.7kg (2.2 and 3.7lb) of healthcare waste per bed each day, according to Health Care Without Harm (HCWH), a global non-profit working to reduce healthcare services' negative impacts on the environment and people. One study estimates low-income countries produce up to 6kg (13.3lb) of hazardous waste per bed per day, which rises to 11kg (24.3lb) in high-income nations.

The safe approach to medical waste management is to separate and treat wastes differently. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 15% of healthcare waste is hazardous material that may be infectious, toxic or radioactive. Waste must all be segregated before disposal, but just one-third of healthcare facilities do this. This has a detrimental impact on people and the planet. About 5.2 million people, including four million children, die each year from waste-related diseases around the world.
Burning rubbish now UK’s dirtiest form of power.
Burning household rubbish in giant incinerators to make electricity is now the dirtiest way the UK generates power, BBC analysis has found.

Nearly half of the rubbish produced in UK homes, including increasing amounts of plastic, is now being incinerated. Scientists warn it is a “disaster for the climate” - and some are calling for a ban on new incinerators.

The BBC examined five years of data from across the country, and found that burning waste produces the same amount of greenhouse gases for each unit of energy as coal power, which was abandoned by the UK last month.

The Environmental Services Association, which represents waste firms, contested our findings and said emissions from dealing with waste are “challenging to avoid”.

Nearly 15 years ago, the government became seriously concerned with the gases being produced from throwing away household rubbish in landfill and their contribution to climate change. In response, it hiked the taxes UK councils paid for burying waste.

Facing massive bills, councils turned to energy-from-waste plants - a type of incinerator that produces electricity from burning rubbish. The number of incinerators surged - in the past five years the number in England alone has risen from 38 to 52. About 3.1% of the UK’s energy comes from waste incinerators.
